# Google Calendar Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up Google Calendar integration for the AI Planner App.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform account
- Access to the Google Cloud Console

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
3. Enter project name: "AI Planner App"
4. Click "Create"

## Step 2: Enable Google Calendar API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
2. Search for "Google Calendar API"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"

## Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth client ID"
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - User Type: External
   - App name: AI Planner App
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact: Your email
   - Add scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
   - Add test users (your email) if in testing mode
4. Create OAuth client ID:
   - Application type: Web application
   - Name: AI Planner Web Client
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - For development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback`
     - For production: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback`
5. Click "Create"
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your Vercel project or `.env.local` file:

\`\`\`bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1011319456671-fb7o669jkhe8dukgpurv8ukfc82hog0c.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://difabskwzjbhjiwpdldb.supabase.co  # or your production URL
\`\`\`

### In Vercel:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add the three variables above
4. Redeploy your application

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Sign up or log in to the app
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Calendar Integration
3. Click "Connect" on Google Calendar
4. Authorize the app to access your Google Calendar
5. Once connected, click "Sync Now" to sync your workouts and meals

## Features

Once connected, the app will:

- Sync your scheduled workouts to Google Calendar (marked with üèãÔ∏è)
- Sync your meal plans to Google Calendar (marked with üçΩÔ∏è)
- Automatically refresh tokens when they expire
- Allow manual sync from the Settings page

## Troubleshooting

### "Google OAuth not configured" error
- Make sure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are set in your environment variables
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### "Failed to exchange code for tokens" error
- Verify your redirect URI matches exactly what's configured in Google Cloud Console
- Check that the Google Calendar API is enabled

### "Not authenticated" error
- Make sure you're logged in to the app
- Try logging out and logging back in

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Keep your Client Secret secure
- Use different OAuth credentials for development and production
- Regularly rotate your credentials
- Review the OAuth consent screen settings to ensure minimal scope access

## API Rate Limits

Google Calendar API has the following limits:
- 1,000,000 queries per day
- 10 queries per second per user

The app automatically handles token refresh and respects these limits.
